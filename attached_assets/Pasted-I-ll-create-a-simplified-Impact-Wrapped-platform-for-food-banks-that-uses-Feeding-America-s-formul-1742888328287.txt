I'll create a simplified "Impact Wrapped" platform for food banks that uses Feeding America's formulas for consistent impact reporting. This solution will have two main components: an admin dashboard for food banks to upload data, and the donor-facing impact experience.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

I've built a simplified "Impact Wrapped" platform for food banks that leverages Feeding America's standard formulas for consistent impact reporting. This FREE solution includes two main components:

## 1. Admin Portal for Food Banks

The admin interface makes it easy for food bank staff to:

- **Upload donor data** via CSV file with basic information (name, email, donation amount)
- **Customize the experience** with their food bank's branding and thank you message
- **Generate personalized links** that can be shared with donors by email or other channels

The system automatically applies Feeding America's standardized conversion metrics:
- $1 = 10 meals provided
- 12 meals = helping 1 person for a month
- 1.2 pounds of food = 1 meal
- Each pound of food rescued saves 2.5 lbs of CO₂ emissions
- Each pound of food rescued saves 108 gallons of water

## 2. Donor-Facing Impact Experience

Donors receive a personalized, interactive journey that includes the six slides you specified:

1. **Welcome Slide** - Personalized greeting with food bank branding
2. **Meals Provided Slide** - Visual representation of meals their donation provided
3. **People Helped Slide** - Shows how many neighbors received food thanks to them
4. **Giving History Slide** - Key milestones including first gift, largest gift, and total giving
5. **Thank You Slide** - Heartfelt message and optional video from the food bank
6. **Summary Page** - Comprehensive view of impact metrics with social sharing options

## Key Features

- **Mobile responsive design** that works on all devices
- **Social sharing functionality** so donors can share their impact
- **Consistent metrics** using Feeding America standards
- **Simple setup** requiring minimal technical expertise
- **Fully customizable branding** including logos and colors
- **CSV data import** compatible with most donor management systems

This simplified platform gives food banks an easy, free way to create engaging donor impact reports without requiring technical expertise or budget. Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
